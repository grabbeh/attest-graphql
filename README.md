# attest-graphql

This is the graphql server which supports the attest frontend at https://github.com/grabbeh/attest. It originally formed part of that repository but conflict issues with Next 5 meant it was necessary to transfer out.

**Dependencies**

- A MongoDB database string referenced in /config/db.js matching:

```
module.exports = 'mongodb://username:password@ipaddress/dbname'
```

**Development**

```
git clone
npm install
npm run compile-graph
node ./graphql/compiled/server.js
```

This starts the GraphQL server running on localhost:8000 (and GraphiQL, a GUI for the server, can be accessed at localhost:8000/graphiql)

**Production**

```
npm run compile-graph
npm run start-graph
```
